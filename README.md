# PolarizationMicroscopy
An overview of how we measure fluorescence polarization in living cells

'Read_Agar_Images_rotation.m' is set up to read in the whole-image pixel intensity sum for 8 image fields of 2 samples at 9 different polarizing filter angles.
The whole-image pixel intensity sum values are then plotted for either fluorescence channel.

'Read_Agar_Images_final.m' is set up to compute and plot the whole-image fluorescence anisotropy difference between two samples. (8 fields per sample).

'Display_Agar_images.m' reads and displays fluorescent cells from a selected file.
